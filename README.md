# CADmodels
A repository of my public CAD 3d models  
Acts as a databank for all of the models that I have made in CAD, most of them being small models I have made in like 5 minutes so do not expect anything impressive or good  
I might sort them into folders and fix some of them in the future but this currently serves as a web file bank i can just `git clone` into any of my computers and/or use as a reference
